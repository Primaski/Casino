(F1) COMMAND STRUCTURE

STRUCTURE:
[KEYWORD *] [TABLE ACTION ,] [HAND ACTION *]

KEY:
* - Required
, - May have more than one argument

(F2) KEYWORD DEFINITIONS

-throwaway / throw => Discard a card of yours onto the table.

-pickup => Pick up a card or set of cards from the table. This does incorporate builds, but
only builds CREATED on THE SAME TURN. For existing builds (that have been named), we would use "capture".

-build => Build up to a value, using some combination of the cards on the table, and one of your own 
cards. This is ALWAYS a non-capturing move where you are preparing for later. Single builds, multiple builds,
and locking builds are all incorporated in this keyword, so long as the capture is not in the same turn.
Please note that you cannot combine or build on locked builds. It is recommended to use the game's generated nicknames 
for existing builds.

-capture => There is an existing build (that has already been named), and now you are on your capturing
move. You will finish any desired additions to your build, and use the card from your hand to seal the
coffin on this build. Please note that you cannot combine or build on locked builds. It is highly 
recommended to use the game's generated nicknames for the builds here, to save your fingers unnecessary stress.

(F3) EXAMPLES

-throwaway 7
English meaning: Throwaway [my] 7
Contextual meaning: I can't or don't want to do anything, so I am trailing my 7.
THIS IS A NON-CAPTURE MOVE. (note: "throw" also works)

-pickup 8
English meaning: Pickup [the] 8
Contextual meaning: Pick up the only eight on the table with your only eight.

-pickup k
English meaning: Pickup [the] k
Contextual meaning: Pick up the only king on the table with your only king.

-pickup 8h 8s
English meaning: Pickup [the] 8h [with my] 8s
Contextual meaning: Pick up the table's 8 of hearts with your 8 of spades

-pickup 52 7
English meaning: Pickup [the] 5 [and] 2 [with my] 7
Contextual meaning: I want to build 5 and 2 to make 7, and then pick it up immediately.
There is also no ambiguity in what I'm referring to.

-pickup 5h2s 7h
English meaning: Pickup [the] 5h [and] 2s [with my] 7h
Contextual meaning: I want to build the 5 of Hearts and the 2 of Spades, and then pick it up
immediately. There might be ambiguity in my command, so I included the suit names.

-pickup 23a4 5
English meaning: Pickup [the] 2 [and] 3 [alongwiththe] a [and] 4 [with my] 5
Contextual meaning: This is a multiple build

-build 3 5
English meaning: Build [using the table's] 3 [and my] 5
Contextual meaning: I have an 8 in my hand, and cannot capture this turn since I used my only move to 
add the 5 to the table, but I am hoping to use my 8 to pick it up later.

-build 35 8
English meaning: Build [using the table's] 3 [and] 5 [and then secure it with my] 8
Contextual meaning: I am using the table's 3 and 5 to build it up to an 8, and then "locking" the
build with my own 8. This implies I can capture it with another 8 on a different turn. THIS IS  A 
"LOCKED" BUILD.

-build 358 8
English meaning: Build [using the table's] 3 [,] 5 [and] 8 [and then secure it with my] 8
Contextual meaning: I am using the table's 3 and 5 to build it up to an 8, "locking" it with the table's 8,
and then adding in my own 8. This implies I have another 8 that I can capture it with later. THIS IS A
"LOCKED" BUILD.

-build alpha 5
English meaning: Build alpha [further by adding my own] 5
Contextual meaning: There is some build that the game named alpha, whose value adds up to 5, and
you would like to add to it with your own 5. This implies that you have another 5.

-build alpha2 3
English meaning: Build alpha [with the table's] 2 [and my own] 3
Contextual meaning: Assume alpha is 5 (this would work with any value of alpha 5 or lower). 
You added a 2 from the table, and a 3 from your hand to make it 10. This assumes you have a 10 
in your hand, but you can't capture it yet. THIS ONLY WORKS IF THE BUILD IS NOT LOCKED.

-capture alpha 10
English meaning: Capture [the build] alpha [with my] 10
Contextual meaning: Some build alpha exists where its value is 10, and you used your 10 to capture it.

-capture alpha3 9
English meaning: Capture [the build] alpha [after adding a] 3 [and using my] 9
Contextual meaning: Let's assume the value of the build alpha was 6, but it was not locked. We could add
a 3 from the table, and capture the build with our 9. Success!


[********TODO: CHECK THIS WITH WIKIA RULES ON COMBINING BUILDS***********]
-capture alphabeta 10
English meaning: Capture alpha [and] beta [with my] 10
Contextual meaning: This is ambiguous, yet has the same outcome.
Case 1: Alpha and beta are NOT locked, and don't add up to the same value, but their value adds up to 10.
Case 2: Alpha and beta are NOT locked, match in value, and their values are 10.
In both of these cases, we may use our 10 to combine the existing builds on the table and steal them.

-capture alphabeta3 9
English meaning: Capture alpha [,] beta [, and] 3 [with my] 9
Contextual meaning: 3 can be combined with either alpha or beta's builds to have its individual
sums equal 9, and then we can capture it with 9.
